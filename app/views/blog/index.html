      The much awaited return of Trials of Osiris has been announced. In their most recent Weekly Update Bungie confirmed that Trials of Osiris
      returns on the weekend of 10/30.<br/>

      Ready your arms against your opponents guardians. You must be ruthless, they will not relent. Your competitive companion,
      Destiny Trials Report, is readily at your side as you battle for the lighthouse.<br/>

    <p>
      We've redesigned the entire app to show you more of the stats you need in clearer ways.
      That's not all, Guardians. We've gone ahead and outfitted the app with the new Cathedral of Dusk crucible map that has yet
      to be released. We expect this map will make its debut for the return of Trials!
